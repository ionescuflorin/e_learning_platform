# 1.Planning your app

1.4 Define where state should live


2. Organizing our project
2.1 Folder structure
Elements
Buttons, Icons, Inputs, etc. â€” all those are elements which are used over and over again. They are low-level items, reused in multiple components.
Components
Even though almost everything is called a component in React, I use a more precise definition for the term in my folder structure.
Containers
As a third and last type of component, there are containers. Containers are our state-managing components.

2.2 Class-based vs. functional components
2.3 CSS modules or SASS

3. Building the app
3.1 Build a static version of your application
3.2 Identify and implement the minimal state your app needs
3.3 Add functions to mutate state and thus make the UI interactive
